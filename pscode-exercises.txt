// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Addition of two numbers
   Add (a)+(b)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Check if a number is even:
  "int" Print "even" a/2 with no remainder
    print "ODD" if "int" has a remainder

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Input (A,B,C,D,E)

b) Add int (A+B+C+D+E)=Sum
    SUM/ Total integers = average
    Print average
c) Determine Minimum and Maximum
    Input 5 numbers
     Print minimum  integer
print maximum integer   


d)  Example (1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)
         1+2+3+4+5=15 
Average= 3
Min=1 Maximum= 5
(not sure if this is what was wanted for "d")
